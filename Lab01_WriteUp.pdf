1) I made a function for each option in the menu. Each function had the responsibilities of just executing the options within the interactive menu. Also, I had 2 functions that handled valid input sould the program wouldn't continue unless user entered a valid choice. 

2) I did not add any help classes.

3) I would have to have more values in the Pokemon.h file and add more "getters" and "setters." Also, I would have to add slightly more code when creating each individual Pokemon in the Executive.cpp file. 

4) I didn't fully understand the full use of it so I didn't use it much. However, it did help with the location of some segfaults.
